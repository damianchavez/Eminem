<p>Marshall Mathers was born on 17 October 1972 in Saint Joseph, Missouri. He grew up without a father who after given chances to stay in contact with Marshall still chose not to. His mother had a hard time keeping a job so the two were always on the move to different states. This impacted Marshall greatly because he would transfer schools a couple times a year so he never had close friends but he would get bullied for being the outcast of every new school he attended. In addition he didn't like school and failed freshmen year three times before finally dropping out. However his passion for English was strong that he would enjoy reading the dictionary. He says he did this to have various words that he can use whenever he had to pull them out. He also didn't have a great relationship with his mom whom he said was addicted to drugs and abused him physically and emotionally. He decided afterwards to express his childhood with the rich vocabulary he did and was a fan of a famous gangster rap crew named N.W.A. Although rappers were typically dark skin he decided to enter in detroit rap battles where he earned respect because of his skills. When he would perform he would go by his stage name "M&M" which were his initials that he later started to write as "Eminem".</p>
