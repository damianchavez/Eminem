                <p>Marshall Mathers is a well known fair skinned rapper. His skin tone actually played a big part in his life because he was not hired by anyone since he was white so most believed he wouldn't do well rapping. He was at the point in his life where he was giving up because he could no longer achieve his goal when Dr. Dre had heard about him and saw potential in him so he helped him out since other record labels and musicians didn't think he wasn't good enough to work with. Eventually Marshall Mathers made a name for himself and is now popularly known as Eminem. I find his backstory to be very interesting along with most of his music so thats why I decided to make a fan page on him. His music inspires me to work hard since he does a good job of telling how the real world is sometimes and how tough it could be so you just got to continue and give it your best.</p>

                <p>Although Eminem may not lead by a great example, I would say he is a very confident and upright individual. He kept trying even though he kept being put down based on his skin and now most might be regretting rejecting Eminem because he has become popular. I like some of the lyrics in his songs because it has a great maessage and teaches a lesson. In addition to that he is an amazing rapper and proved that through his music, especially Forever by Drake. Lose yourself by Eminem in particular I like to listen before my races because the message he sends is you have one shot to prove yourself so even though your nervous you gotta make the best of it; the specific lyric is "Look if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment would you capture it or just let it slip?" -Eminem.</p>
